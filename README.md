# dc-lib
This repository should eventually contain some macros for use with `dc`, the calculator language that originated in the 1970s.

## bit.dc
This file contains definitions for the bitwise operations AND, OR, XOR, and NOT.

## ZI.dc
This file contains a macro that is similar to the `Z` command, except that it counts digits with respect to the current input radix.
